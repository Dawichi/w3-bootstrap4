# w3-bootstrap4
Summary of the [Bootstrap 4](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/) course from w3schools.

It is a summary of all then content of the course on a single markdown archive, for personal use when I need check some bootstrap classes.

---

This file was generated with my favourite markdown editor: [Typora](https://typora.io/).

Links may does not work with some stardad markdown editors/viewers. In case some kinda error. opening it with Typora should works perfectly, and then you can generate a PDF or whatever you want to do with the content. 

I hope this can help you studying Bootstrap4 or that it will be as useful as me to consult quick questions about it.
Cheers <3
